<h2>What is Usability</h2>

<p>Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.</p>

<p>Usability is defined by 5 quality components:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Learnability:</strong> How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?</li>
	<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?</li>
	<li><strong>Memorability:</strong> When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?</li>
	<li><strong>Errors:</strong> How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?</li>
	<li><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> How pleasant is it to use the design?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Glossary</h2>


<strong>Affordance</strong>

<p>The properties of an object that inform people how the object could be used. The term 'perceived affordance' applies when the object properties are perceived in a way that differs from the real-world, physical properties, especially when the usage of the object depends on perceived rather than real-world properties.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Chunking</strong>

<p>The human ability to group information into related small sets, which can then be stored in short-term memory. By keeping information in smaller pieces, the functional storage capacity of the brain is increased. Information is often presented in a chunked format to facilitate human memory, for example North American phone numbers are often grouped into the xxx-xxx-xxxx pattern. Familiarly with the information and/or rehearsal of it increases the person's ability to remember the information.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Cognitive Walkthrough</strong>

<p>The cognitive walkthrough is a usability evaluation method in which one or more evaluators work through a series of tasks and ask a set of questions from the perspective of the user.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Easy to Learn</strong>

<p>The aspect of usability that focuses on facilitating the users learning of an interface, with minimum time and effort spent in the learning phase.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Fitts' Law</strong>

<p>The further away a target is, and the smaller its size, the longer it will take for a user to reach it. The time required to move from a starting point to within the confines of a target area is dependent on a logarithmic relationship between the distance from the point to the target area and the size of the target.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Function Allocation</strong>

<p>Function allocation is a classic human factors method for deciding whether a particular function will be accomplished by a person, technology (hardware or software) or some mix of person and technology. To do this, the investigator considers error rates, fatigue, costs, hazards, technological feasibility, human values, ethical issues, and the desire of people to perform the function.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Gestalt Principles</strong>

<p>Humans visually perceive items not in isolation, but as part of a larger whole. These principles include humans tendencies towards similarity, proximity, continuity, and closure.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Graceful Degradation</strong>

<p>Systems should be designed so that when features that take advantage of new technologies are disabled, the content maintains effectiveness for the users. For example, older Web browsers and browsers which allow users to disable features will display page content in a simplified format.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Heuristic</strong>

<p>A usability guideline for evaluating a user interface, which can be used to identify design problems. Usability heuristics often need to be adjusted depending on the interface and the technology used. There are lists of heuristics that have been compiled by various people and organizations that are commonly used for this method.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Heuristic Evaluation</strong>

<p>A usability evaluation method in which one or more reviewers, preferably experts, compare a software, documentation, or hardware product to a list of design principles (commonly referred to as heuristics) and identify where the product does not follow those principles.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Hick's law </strong>

<p>The time it takes to make a decision increases proportionally to the number and complexity of choices. Hick's law is the appropriate model in choosing an alternative from a menu or navigation bar for decision times, rather than Miller's "magic number" of seven plus or minus two.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Learnability</strong>

<p>A measure of the degree to which a user interface can be learned; an attribute of a usable system.  The ease of learning the functionality of a system and gaining proficiency to complete basic and necessary tasks. Factors affecting this measure include the amount of time, training, and support required for the user to learn the system.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Think-aloud Protocol</strong>

<p>A direct observation method of user testing that involves asking users to think out loud as they are performing a task. Users are asked to say whatever they are looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling at each moment. This method is especially helpful for determining users' expectations and identifying what aspects of a system are confusing.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Usability Evaluation</strong>

<p>Assessing the usability of a product with the purpose of identifying usability problems and/or obtaining usability measures. The purpose of evaluation can be to improve the usability of the product as part of design/development, or to assess the extent to which usability objectives have been achieved.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Wayfinding</strong>

<p>How people orient themselves and navigate in a built environment, both physical and virtual.</p>
