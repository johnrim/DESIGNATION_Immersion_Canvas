<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>While design is not a science, there are still principles that guide it as a discipline. To begin, let's go over the fundamental building blocks of design.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Principles of Design</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>BALANCE</strong> - Balance in design is similar to balance in physics. A large shape close to the center can be balanced by a small shape close to the edge. Balance provides stability and structure to a design. It&rsquo;s the weight distributed in the design by the placement of your elements.</li>
<li><strong>PROXIMITY</strong> - Proximity creates relationship between elements. It provides a focal point. Proximity doesn&rsquo;t mean that elements have to be placed together, it means they should be visually connected in someway.</li>
<li><strong>ALIGNMENT</strong> - Allows us to create order and organisation. Aligning elements allows them to create a visual connection with each other.</li>
<li><strong>REPETITION</strong> - Repetition strengthens a design by tying together individual elements. It helps to create association and consistency. Repetition can create rhythm (a feeling of organized movement).</li>
<li><strong>CONTRAST</strong> - Contrast is the juxtaposition of opposing elements (opposite colours on the colour wheel, or value light / dark, or direction - horizontal / vertical). Contrast allows us to emphasize or highlight key elements in your design.</li>
<li><strong>SPACE</strong> - Space refers to the distance or area between, around, or within elements. Both positive and negative space are important factors to be considered in every design.
