<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The design sprint is a process for prototyping and testing any product in 5 days. Design-thinking compressed into a short time-frame:<p>
<p><strong>Define -> Research -> Ideation -> Prototype -> Choose -> Implement -> Learn</strong></p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> [Understand](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-understandday-1)
Dig into the design problem through research, competitive review, and strategy exercises.</li>

   <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> <a href="http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-divergeday2" target="_blank">Diverge</a>: Rapidly develop as many solutions as possible.</li>

   <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> [Decide](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-decideday3)
Choose the best ideas and hammer out a user story.</li>

   <li><strong>Day 4:</strong> [Prototype](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-prototypeday4)
Build something quick and dirty that can be shown to users.</li>

   <li><strong>Day 5:</strong> [Validate](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-validateday5)
Show the prototype to real humans (in other words, people outside your company) and learn what works and what doesnâ€™t work.</li>
