<h2>Design Process</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set a schedule and deadline(s)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Be realistic! Don't be overly optimistic about your capabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Figure out who you're designing the product for</strong>
<ul>
<li>User personas are extremely helpful for identifying your target audience
<li>Create use cases for these potential users: what is their purpose on the site, what sort of information are they looking for, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Develop and understand the content <em>first</em></strong>
<ul>
<li>Form follows function!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Create a moodboard or inspiration board</strong></li>

<li><strong>Start with a sketch</strong>
<ul>
<li>Don't jump right into Photoshop or Illustrator!</li>
<li>The sketch can be a high-fidelity wireframe or something more loose</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Create a grid first!</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you're using bootstrap, this would be a 12 column grid</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Develop a unifying style guide</strong>
<ul>
<li>Choose the typography</li>
<li>Identify the type hierarchy</li>
<li>Define the color palette</li>
<li>Define the visual styling for specific content types</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Finish a rough draft before trying to throw something away and start over</strong>
<ul>
<li>It's easier to iterate once you have the outline of a complete website finished, even if it's ugly. You'll start to see a larger pattern develop in your mind when you complete the whole thought.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Give yourself enough time to reflect on your own work</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is my 24 hour rule. You need to have enough time to sleep on your design and look at it again in the morning with a fresh pair of eyes.</li>
<li>It's hard to be objective about one's own work in the moment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Share your work with peers</strong>
<ul>
<li>Try to illicit feedback from fellow designers who may offer constructive criticism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Iterate!</strong>
<ul>
<li>A design is rarely finished with its first pass. Keep refining and polishing the design</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
