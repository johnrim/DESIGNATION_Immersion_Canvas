<h2>How to Choose the Right Images:</h2>

<li><strong>The image should help tell a story.</strong>
Images should always be in service of the overall message of a page.</li> 

<li><strong>Quality counts!</strong>
Don't pick images that are grainy or out of focus, unless it's in service of a specific aesthetic.</li>

<li><strong>Be consistent with images</strong>
Pick images with similar or consistent lighting for a website. The images should all feel like they were either all taken by the same photographer or done in the same style.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid images that look like stock photography.</strong>
Consumers are “image-savvy,” meaning they know a stock photo when they see one.  This doesn't mean you can't use stock photography, but rather you need to be careful in your selection of stock images.  You want to avoid anything that screams cheesy stock image.</li>

<li><strong>Find images that make use of negative space</strong>
Negative space in photography is critical for header graphics.  It leaves room for a perfect headline, and has a clean focus on the subject matter.</li>

<li><strong>Strive for originality</strong>
The choice of image doesn't always have be literal. You can choose images that are metaphorical or has a specific unique aesthetic</li>

<li><strong>Evoke an emotional response</strong>
Emotion often plays a part in the purchasing process. Images that provoke a favorable response guide viewers towards making the decision to purchase.</li>

<li><strong>Choose images that reinforce the brand</strong>
Every business has its own unique look and feel—its brand. The images selected for the website should be consistent with that brand.</li>

<li><strong>Crop images for greater impact</strong>
Many “perfect” photographs can be enhanced even more by a careful cropping. There’s often a lot of wasted space around the edges of a photograph. Getting rid of that empty space helps draw the visitor’s eye precisely where you want it to go.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid busy images</strong>
Images that are too busy makes it difficult for the viewer to know where to look. Pick image that have clarify.  It should draw their eye to what you want them to see.</li>

<li><strong>Choose tight focused shots</strong>
Macro shots are a great choice for creating clarity and impact on a product shot.</li>

<li><strong>Feature people who resemble your target audience.</strong>
A website aimed at teenage skateboarding fanatics should obviously avoid using images of infants or senior citizens</li>
