<h2>Objectives &amp; Outline</h2>
<ol>
<li>Survey of research synthesis techniques</li>
<li>Gain practical experience performing synthesis</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Research Analysis Methods</h2>
<p>Analysis is the part of the process where the research is broken down, taken apart, studied, and understood. The process of analysis helps a design team understand the problem they have been asked to solve.</p>
<p>According to Jon Kolko, design synthesis is an abductive sensemaking process. Abduction can be thought of as the "step of adopting a hypothesis as being suggested by the facts . . . a form of inference."</p>

<h2>User Modeling: Personas</h2>
<p>User personas are realistic representations of your key audience segments for your product/service. The goal of personas is not to represent every possible audience member but rather to address the major needs of the most important user groups.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Personas are based on user research and data</li>
<li>Personas are realistic but fictional characters</li>
<li>Personas can be used for usability testing and product design</li>
<li>Personas helps everyone on the team to be on the same page</li>
<li>Personas should only be 1 page</li>
<li>Personas should address what the user needs, wants and limitations are</li>
<li>Typically, there will be 3-5 personas created for a project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p><strong>Affinity Diagramming</strong></p>
<p>Affinity diagramming is a participatory method where concepts written on cards are sorted into related groups and sub-groups. The original intent of affinity diagramming was to help diagnose complicated problems by organizing qualitative data to reveal themes associated with the problems.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Card Sorting</strong></p>
<p>A method for organizing information that involves sorting a series of cards into groups that make sense to the participants. Each card represents a single term, function or object. Card sorting helps to reveal users' mental models, or patterns that the end users would expect to find.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Competitor Analysis</strong></p>
<p>A method for identifying the strengths and weaknesses of competing products or services before starting work on prototypes.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Contextual Inquiry</strong></p>
<p>A semi-structured field interviewing method based on a set of principles that allow it to be molded to different situations. This technique is generally used at the beginning of the design process and is good for getting rich information, but can be complex and time consuming.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Diary Study</strong></p>
<p>A diary study requires users, or observers of users, to keep track of activities or events in some form of diary or log for a particular period of time.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Ethnography</strong></p>
<p>The process of gathering information about users and tasks directly from users in their normal work, home or leisure environment. Ethnography focuses on long-term studies spanning weeks, months, or even years. Information may be collected through participant observation, interviews, audio or video recording, observer logs, artifact collection, diaries and photographs.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Focus Group</strong></p>
<p>A focus group is a focused discussion where a moderator leads a group of participants through a set of questions on a particular topic. Focus groups are often used in the early stages of product planning and requirements gathering to obtain feedback about users, products, concepts, prototypes, tasks, strategies, and environments.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Longitudinal Study</strong></p>
<p>A study that captures data over a period of time (days, week, months or years) to understand the long-term effects of changes in products, processes or environment.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Paper Prototyping</strong></p>
<p>A study conducted on a paper version of a design to get feedback early on in the design process.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Participatory Design</strong></p>
<p>A process that involves developers, business representatives, and users working together to design a solution. It actively involves users in the design process to help ensure that the product designed meets their needs and is usable in the process.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Persona</strong></p>
<p>Fictional person created to model and describe the goals, needs, and characteristics of a specific type or group of users. Does not describe a real, individual user nor an average user. Often includes made-up personal details to make the fictional person more "real".</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Photo Study</strong></p>
<p>Users take photos to highlight important aspects of their lives and context. The photos are assembled into collages and studied to highlight opportunities for new technologies and barriers to their acceptance.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
<p>A story which has the key elements of a realistic situation when the user would interact with the system being designed or evaluated. The scenario includes consideration of the user's goals, tasks and interaction. Scenarios can be created for user groups, workflows or tasks to explore, understand and test the different types of needs and goals.</p>
