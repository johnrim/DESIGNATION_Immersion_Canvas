<h2>Brief</h2>
<p><em>&ldquo;Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.&rdquo;</em> &mdash;Tim Brown, president and CEO of IDEO</p>
<p>Design thinking is a methodology that combines empathy for the context of a problem, creativity in the generation of insights and ideas, and rationality in analyzing and fitting various solutions to create a solution.</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>Over the course of the next few weeks, you will learn how to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking" target="_blank">design thinking</a> to approach problem-solving for users in an interactive design.</p>
<p>The main stages of this process, while it varies from company to company, roughly breaks down as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Empathize/Research</strong> Empathy is the centerpiece of a human-centered design process. The Empathize mode is the work you do to understand people, within the context of your design challenge. It is your effort to understand the way they do things and why, their physical and emotional needs, how they think about world, and what is meaningful to them.</li>
	<li><strong>Define</strong> The Define mode of the design process is all about bringing clarity and focus to the design space. It is your chance, and responsibility, as a design thinker to define the challenge you are taking on, based on what you have learned about your user and about the context. After becoming an instant-expert on the subject and gaining invaluable empathy for the person you are designing for, this stage is about making sense of the widespread information you have gathered.</li>
	<li><strong>Ideate</strong> Ideate is the mode of the design process in which you concentrate on idea generation. Mentally it represents a process of &ldquo;going wide&rdquo; in terms of concepts and outcomes. Ideation provides both the fuel and also the source material for building prototypes and getting innovative solutions into the hands of your users.</li>
	<li><strong>Prototype</strong> The Prototype mode is the iterative generation of artifacts intended to answer questions that get you closer to your final solution. A prototype can be anything that a user can interact with &ndash; be it a wall of post-it notes, a gadget you put together, a role-playing activity, or even a storyboard. Ideally you bias toward something a user can experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Test</strong> The Test mode is when you solicit feedback, about the prototypes you have created, from your users and have another opportunity to gain empathy for the people you are designing for. Testing is another opportunity to understand your user, but unlike your initial empathy mode, you have now likely done more framing of the problem and created prototypes to test. Ideally you can test within a real context of the user&rsquo;s life.</li>
	<li><strong>Iterate</strong> Iteration is fundamental to good design. Iterate both by cycling through the steps 1-5 multiple times, and also by iterating within a step&mdash;for example by creating multiple prototypes or trying variations of a brainstorming topics with multiple groups. Generally as you take multiple cycles through the design process your scope narrows and you move from working on the broad concept to the nuanced details, but the process still supports this development.</li>
