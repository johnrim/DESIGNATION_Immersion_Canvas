<h2>Objectives &amp; Outline</h2>
<ol>
<li>Understand how to describe the user's interactions with a product through stories and scenarios.</li>
<li>Learn how to create a high-fidelity customer journey map.</li>
<li>Learn how to create use cases and user flows.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>When creating human-centered solutions, you will need to describe how the user will interact with the product or service. This can be done through a variety of artifacts and techniques. The most common examples are: user stories, user scenarios, use cases, customer journey maps, and user flows.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p>A use case details the list of steps a user might take in trying to get a specific task accomplished. It starts with whatever event serves as a trigger for their interaction with your system and recounts what happens at each and every step. Use cases are typically defined by product managers.</p>
<h2>Elements of a Use Case</h2>
<ul>
<li>Actor &ndash; anyone or anything that performs a behavior (who is using the system)</li>
<li>Stakeholder &ndash; someone or something with vested interests in the behavior of the system under discussion (SUD)</li>
<li>Primary Actor &ndash; stakeholder who initiates an interaction with the system to achieve a goal</li>
<li>Preconditions &ndash; what must be true or happen before and after the use case runs.</li>
<li>Triggers &ndash; this is the event that causes the use case to be initiated.</li>
<li>Main success scenarios [Basic Flow] &ndash; use case in which nothing goes wrong.</li>
<li>Alternative paths [Alternative Flow] &ndash; these paths are a variation on the main theme. These exceptions are what happen when things go wrong at the system level.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>User flows</h2>
<p>User flows are a form of visual documentation that illustrates how users encounter your system, as well as the sequence of their interactions once they get there. This is where user stories, scenarios and use cases can be mapped out in a way that applies more directly to information architecture and user interface design decisions. These flowcharts are a preliminary step toward more detailed wireframing and prototyping.</p>

<h2>Customer Journey Maps</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Customer journey maps are documents that visually illustrate an individual customer&rsquo;s needs, the series of interactions that are necessary to fulfill those needs, and the resulting emotional states a customer experiences throughout the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Customer journey maps are documents that visually illustrate an individual customer&rsquo;s needs, the series of interactions that are necessary to fulfill those needs, and the resulting emotional states a customer experiences throughout the process.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>need</strong>&mdash;what a customer has set out to achieve</li>
<li><strong>interactions</strong>&mdash;the necessary steps for a customer to satisfy those needs and achieve the overall goal</li>
<li><strong>emotions</strong>&mdash;the customer&rsquo;s emotional state&mdash;including needs met, goals accomplished, and satisfaction level&mdash;before, during, and after the experience</li>
</ul>
<p>By detailing a customer&rsquo;s needs throughout an experience and revealing how each interaction negatively or positively impacts the customer&rsquo;s emotional state, UX professionals can convert volumes of research findings and analysis into a concise, yet visually compelling story, which stakeholders across many levels of an organization can easily understand and interpret.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Journey Maps Must-haves</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personas:</strong> the main characters that illustrate the needs, goals, thoughts, feelings, opinions, expectations, and pain points of the user;</li>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> a finite amount of time (e.g. 1 week or 1 year) or variable phases (e.g. awareness, decision-making, purchase, renewal);</li>
<li><strong>Emotion:</strong> peaks and valleys illustrating frustration, anxiety, happiness etc.;</li>
<li><strong>Touchpoints:</strong> customer actions and interactions with the organization. This is the WHAT the customer is doing;</li>
<li><strong>Channels:</strong> where interaction takes place and the context of use (e.g. website, native app, call center, in-store). This is the WHERE they are interacting.</li>
</ul>
